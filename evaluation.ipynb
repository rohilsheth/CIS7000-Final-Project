      "['Dear John Smith,\\n\\nDuring your hospital stay from June 15th to June 19th, 2022, you visited our eye doctor (Ophthalmologist) because of problems with your vision. You mentioned having trouble focusing, seeing floating spots and flashes of light, and a decrease in the quality of your side (peripheral) vision. After conducting some tests, you were diagnosed with a condition called retinal detachment.\\n\\nWe performed a successful surgery to fix the detached retina in your eye. After the surgery, your vision improved and the problems you had been experiencing were significantly reduced.\\n\\nBefore your stay in the hospital, you were taking the following medications:\\n\\n1. Lithium 600mg by mouth, twice a day\\n2. Metformin 1000mg by mouth, twice a day\\n3. Lisinopril 10mg by mouth, once a day\\n4. Amlodipine 5mg by mouth, once a day\\n\\nUpon being discharged from the hospital, you will continue taking the same medications as before. Additionally, you will need to start two new eye medications to help your eye heal:\\n\\n5. Prednisolone Acetate 1% Eye Drops: use 1 drop in the affected eye, four times a day for 10 days\\n6. Erythromycin Ophthalmic ointment 0.5%: apply a 1cm line of ointment into the affected eye, four times a day for 7 days\\n\\nAfter leaving the hospital, you can return home. Please be cautious while walking around and avoid activities that may strain your eyes. A follow-up appointment should be scheduled with your eye doctor in 2 weeks to check on your progress. \\n\\nWe hope that you continue to feel better and have a smooth recovery. If you have any concerns or questions, please reach out to your healthcare team.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nThe Discharge Team at ABC General Hospital']\n"
